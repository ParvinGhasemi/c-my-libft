# Makefile: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
# Your Makefile must at contain at least the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.
# If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile that compiles your source
# files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra, and -Werror, using cc.
# Additionally, your Makefile must not perform unnecessary relinking.

# To submit bonuses for your project, you must include a bonus rule in your Makefile,
# which will add all the various headers, libraries, or functions that are not allowed in
# the main part of the project. Bonuses must be placed in _bonus.{c/h} files, unless
# the subject specifies otherwise. The evaluation of mandatory and bonus parts is
# conducted separately

# If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
# associated Makefile into a libft folder. Your projectâ€™s Makefile must compile
# the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
